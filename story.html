Then she ate from the third bowl and said that it was just right and finished it. Then she saw three chairs. She sat on the first one and said that it was too hard. Then she sat on the second one and said that it was too soft. Then she sat on the third one and said that it was just right. But suddenly it broke and so she went upstairs. She saw three beds. She slept on the first one and said that it was too hard. Then she slept on the second one and said that it was too soft. Then she slept on the third one and said that it was just right and she went to sleep.
        After some time the bears came back. They saw that someone had eaten their porridge and finished Baby bear's.
